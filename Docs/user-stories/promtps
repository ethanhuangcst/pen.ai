# Feature 2: View Stored Predefined Prompts

## User Story 2.1: View list of stored prompts
As a user,
I want to view all the predefined prompts I previously stored,
So that I can quickly reuse them without retyping.

### Acceptance Criteria 2.1.1: Display prompt list on request
Given the user has previously stored at least one predefined prompt
AND the user is logged into the Pen application
When the user navigates to the "Prompts" section
Then the system displays a scrollable list of all stored prompts


### Acceptance Criteria 2.1.2: Empty state handling
Given the user has not stored any predefined prompts
AND the user is logged into the Pen application
When the user navigates to the "Prompts" section
Then the system displays an empty state view
And the empty state contains:
    - An illustration icon
    - Text: "No prompts saved yet"
